This program is a Tic Tac Toe simulator for Android.

To run the program, use eclipse with the Android SDK and Android Virtual Device Manager
Create an Android Virtual Device using the Manager, have the target be 4.2 and everything else default
Right click the code, go to Run As > Run Configuration > Android Application
	Create a new run configuration and set the target to be the Android Virtual Device previously created

The program should now run.


The game will start automatically, tap the gray boxes to mark it with X's or O's
X's are first, O's are second.

If a player gets three in a row, a win message will appear at the top of the screen.
A reset button will appear at the bottom which will clear the board.
